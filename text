## üñ•Ô∏è **Improved Dashboard HTML**

This dashboard:
- Replaces Firebase with AJAX requests to fetch a GitHub-hosted JSON file (`waypoints.json`) and post telemetry to a placeholder endpoint.
- Maintains all existing features (live map, waypoint management, status controls, telemetry feed).
- Adds error handling for GitHub API rate limits and network issues.
- Supports drag-and-drop waypoints, start/stop controls, and path visualization.
- Uses a simplified JSON structure compatible with the ESP32 code.

### JSON Structure (Expected in `waypoints.json`)
```json
{
  "status": "idle",
  "waypoints": [
    {"id": "wp1", "lat": 40.7128, "lng": -74.0060, "sequence": 0, "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "wp2", "lat": 40.7130, "lng": -74.0050, "sequence": 1, "status": "pending"}
  ]
}
